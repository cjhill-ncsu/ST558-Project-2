# ST558-Project-2

This project is designed to showcase several important features available in the Shiny package in R. The app allows the user to subset a fictitious dataset from Kaggle using drop down menus and sliders. This filtered data can then be viewed in several visual representations, as well as in tabular form. The filtered dataset can also be downloaded for further analysis if needed.
